I am currently a Ph.D. student at [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ia.cas.cn/). My advisor is [Prof. Jianhua Tao](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~taojianhua?language=en). My research interests include speech recognition, language modeling, keyword spotting. I am also interested in other applications and mechanisms of deep learning. My mid-term goal is to make machines better understand (or structuralize) multimedia data.
